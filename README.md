# HealthChain-
The healthcare industry has seen many technological advancements, but supply chain management is still based on pen-and-paper management or, with some development, a digital method of managing inventory online and tracking it effectively, which is still not up to par and completely dependable. In order to solve this problem, we are utilising blockchain technology, which provides a superior method of tracking and tracing information through a peer-to-peer distributed, secure, and shared ledger of the blockchain network.
